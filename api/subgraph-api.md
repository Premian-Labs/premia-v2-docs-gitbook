# Subgraph API

### <mark style="color:blue;">Overview</mark>

The Premia Subgraph is available on every chain the protocol is available on. The subgraph efficiently indexes expensive-to-store data emitted on-chain, to enable applications to query more advanced data much faster and with less computation than querying these values from an Ethereum node provider (such as Infura, Alchemy, Ankr, etc).

These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query Premia data.
