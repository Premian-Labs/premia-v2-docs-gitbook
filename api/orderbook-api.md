The Premia Subgraph is available on every chain the protocol is available on. The subgraph efficiently indexes expensive-to-store data emitted on-chain, to enable applications to query more advanced data much faster and with less computation than querying these values from an Ethereum node provider (such as Infura, Alchemy, Ankr, etc).
