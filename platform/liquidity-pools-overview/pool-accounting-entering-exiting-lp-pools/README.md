# Pool Accounting and LP Returns

### **TLDR;**

* **Liquidity is arranged in the same sequence it is deposited - first in, first out**
* **LPs can withdraw their funds at any time after the initial 24h lock**
* **LPs can either unwind their liquidity gradually, or express-withdraw their entire position**
* **LPs know exactly how much they are earning and how their capital is deployed, granularly**
* **Premia ensures fair accounting for LPs, depending on when they got in the pool and how long their capital has been deployed**

Pool accounting is not a simple problem to solve. Premia has taken no shortcuts when it comes to providing the best possible user experience to liquidity providers, while ensuring a fair experience for all.
