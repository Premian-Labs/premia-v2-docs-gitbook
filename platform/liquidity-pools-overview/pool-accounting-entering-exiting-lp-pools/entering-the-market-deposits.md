# Entering the Market (Deposits)

**Depositing (adding liquidity to a pool)**

1. Select pool
2. Select amount
3. \[optional] Select swap asset
4. Confirm transaction

All of the available liquidity (Free Capital) in the pool, is sequenced in terms of intervals. Each interval is defined by 3 parameters: \
\
1\) LP wallet address\
2\) interval number\
3\) interval size

**This ensures that liquidity can then be provisioned to underwrite options in a provably fair manner.**
