# Protocol Commissions

Upon creation of a trade on the platform, a taker fee is currently charged:

* Taker Fee - 3% of option premium applied at option creation

Currently upon settlement of any trade a utilization fee is captured.

* Utilization Fee - 2.5% annual interest fee applied at settlement based on length & size

These fees are collected on a source chain level (chain independent), and allocated to vxPREMIA holders on a pro-rata basis of their percentage influence on that source chain.

This is the current implementation on Premia v2 (active version) and is subject to change with the upcoming Premia v3 (next version).
