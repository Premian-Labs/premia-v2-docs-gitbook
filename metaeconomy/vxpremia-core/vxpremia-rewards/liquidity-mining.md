# Liquidity Mining

In order to bootstrap liquidity during the growth phases of the Premia Ecosystem, liquidity mining was introduced to further incentivize liquidity providers in addition to the premiums generated through underwriting products on the Premia Platform.

The target rate was established to maintain low inflation between 0.75 and 1.00 Premia tokens emitted per block to liquidity providers.  As of November 2022 this hovers around 0.905 Premia tokens per block across all supported chains.

* Arbitrum (0.375)
* Ethereum (0.1875)
* Fantom (0.1875)
* Optimism (0.155)

With the coming implementation of the Omnichain Hub Relay, this allocation will be subject for review and amendment.
