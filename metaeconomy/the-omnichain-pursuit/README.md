# The Omnichain Pursuit

The Premian Contribution Network believes the future lies in an omnichain native infrastructure.  The first step to achieve this dream is the implementation of omnichain native vxPremia.  vxPremia is fluid to move between chains at will, and used to allocate valve gauge weights to the Reward Manifold for each chain.  Below is an example visualization of this in practice.
