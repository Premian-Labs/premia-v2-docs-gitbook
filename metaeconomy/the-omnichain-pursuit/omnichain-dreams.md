# Omnichain Dreams

The next step in the Omnichain pursuit is to add an Omnichain Hub Relay (Q2-2023) to direct the chain weight of the liquidity mining reservoir fund to each chain.  However this is just the first step in Premia's omnichain endeavors, more to come.

In addition to omni-chain reward management, the Premia Contributors Network is also looking into omni-chain liquidity management. This would potentially enable all the protocol's liquidity to be stored on a single chain, while still enabling users to transact and interact with the pool's liquidity from the protocol on any other chain. Using the same omni-chain messaging described above, users would potentially be able to deposit, withdraw, or trade with pools on any chain, without first bridging their assets to the chain.
