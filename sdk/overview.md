# Overview

The Premia SDK is available in Typescript and is The codebase can be used to query data stored in smart contracts or to modify data on-chain by signing and executing transactions on-chain.

The SDK is separated into three main groups, for simple understanding:

* **Types & Entities**
*   **Queries (Reads)**

    Queries only read state from contracts on-chain or subgraphs, never update state.
*   **Mutations (Writes)**

    Mutations update the state of a contract on-chain.
