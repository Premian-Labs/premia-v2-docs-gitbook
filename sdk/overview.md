# Overview

The Premia SDK is available in most modern web and mobile programming languages (Python, Javascript, Typescript, Swift, Java, Kotlin, Go, etc). The codebase can be used to query data stored in smart contracts or to modify data on-chain by signing and executing transactions on-chain.

The SDK is separated into three main groups, for simple understanding:

* **Types & Entities**
*   **Queries (Reads)**

    Queries only read state from contracts on-chain or subgraphs, never update state.
*   **Mutations (Writes)**

    Mutations update the state of a contract on-chain.
