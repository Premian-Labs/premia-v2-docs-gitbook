# (depr) Liquidity Mining Program

{% hint style="warning" %}
This has been updated to the [new Liquidity Mining page](../../metaeconomy/vxpremia-core/vxpremia-rewards/liquidity-mining.md)
{% endhint %}

The details of the Liquidity Mining program will be finalized via governance vote before the launch of V2.

Keep in mind, due to how Premia's automated pool pricing works, liquidity mining rewards for LPs will also encourage better prices for buyers. Better prices and increased liquidity results in increased protocol volume, which means higher returns for both LPs and PREMIA stakers.

A win, win, win for everyone involved. ü§ùü§ùü§ù
