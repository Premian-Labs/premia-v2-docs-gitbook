# (depr) Protocol Fees

{% hint style="warning" %}
This has been updated to the [Protocol Commissions page](../../metaeconomy/vxpremia-core/vxpremia-rewards/protocol-commissions.md)
{% endhint %}

The protocol must collect fees in order to grow and survive long-term. No fees are charged on deposit/withdrawal of liquidity from the Premia pools, rather, fees are charged when the pools facilitate a transaction between users.

**Option Purchase:** On option purchase, a protocol fee of 3% of the option's base price is charged to the buyer, included in the price quoted by the pool.

**Option Settlement:** On exercise, a protocol fee of 2.5% annual interest on the option's collateral value is collected from the pool for facilitating the utilization of capital.

As per community vote, 80% of all protocol fees are automatically collected and converted to rewards, which is then distributed to vxPREMIA holders (vxPREMIA holders are PREMIA staking users). The remaining 20% of protocol fees are distributed to the protocol operator, to be used for the further growth and development of the Premia ecosystem.

These fees help to maintain and develop the [suite of tools](../../metaeconomy/operator-and-facilitator-role/operational-expenditure-and-maintenance-costs.md) that make the protocol so great and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Premia ecosystem.
