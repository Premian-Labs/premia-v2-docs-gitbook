# (depr) Bonding Curve Disassembly

The Premia Primary Bootstrap Contribution Whitepaper issued 1 January, 2021 and published in February states in the Distribution section that 25 million Premia tokens will be allocated to the Bonding Curve to be “Reserved for Future Protocol Products” (the “Bonding Curve Tokens”).

In accordance with the vote held by the Premia Community of Premia token holders, submitted on 17 April, 2021 with IPFS identifier `Qmf9B7fWv5UKNDVk1m8VZcWeVNmwkqVWspsPGXSBMu1yxb` regarding the disablement of the Premia Bonding Curve and reallocation of the Bonding Curve Tokens (a “Preliminary Vote”), the Bonding Curve will be disabled commencing 4 September, 2021. In further accordance with the Preliminary Vote, all Bonding Curve Tokens will be migrated to a 3 day “time-locked contract” known as "Premia: Dev Fund" (Contract Address: `0xE43147dAa592C3f88402C6E2b932DB9d97bc1C7f`) “while plans and/or programs for reallocation are determined” to be used for “incentive programs and other allocations”. Premia Protocol Governance (the "Premian Assembly") will be held in the future to approve token distributions to any such plans, programs, incentive programs or any other allocations, unless otherwise defined inherently by a Premian Assembly vote.

\
On 4 September, 2021 a proposal (a "Core Vote") was submitted to execute the steps needed to perform the dismantling of the Bonding Curve. \
