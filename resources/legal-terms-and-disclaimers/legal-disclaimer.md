**IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**

Conflicts of interest may arise whenever Premian Republic Limited or any of its affiliates have actual or perceived economic or other incentives in amending strategies, portfolios, or otherwise to act in a manner that benefits the Premian Republic. Conflicts may occur in the following situations (to the extent permitted in your account): (1) when Premian Republic invests in a DeFi or Crypto investment product, such as a decentralized fund, structured product, separately managed account, or hedge fund issued or managed by Premian Republic Limited or an affiliate; (2) when a Premian Republic entity receives services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate, partner, or smart contract; (3) when Premian Republic receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for any reason; or (4) when Premian Republic receives payment for providing services (including liquidity servicing, options mining, or other platform services) related to investment products. Other conflicts may arise due to Premian Republic's relationships with other clients, projects, and partners or when Premian Republic acts on its own behalf.

Investment strategies are selected from both the Premian Republic and third-party asset managers or strategists and undergo a review process by our research team. From this pool of strategies, our research team selects strategies that align with our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views to meet the user's investment objective.

As a general practice, we prioritize Premian Republic-managed strategies. We anticipate a high proportion (up to 100 percent) of Premian Republic-managed algorithmic strategies in certain portfolios, subject to applicable laws and account-specific considerations.

While our internally managed strategies typically align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes and the firm's risk and compliance philosophy, it is important to note that Premian Republic and staking users receive higher overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. Users have no obligation to use Premian Republic-offered strategy vaults, and as the Premian Republic platform is made up of self-custody-based smart contracts, users are free to deposit at their own discretion.
