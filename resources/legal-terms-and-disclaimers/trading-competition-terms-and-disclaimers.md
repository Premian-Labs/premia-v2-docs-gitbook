Please read these Terms of Service and Disclaimers (these “Terms”) carefully as they form a binding agreement between you and the operator of the Premia Ecosystem of smart contracts (“Premia”), and govern your entry and involvement in the [Premia Blue Trading Competition](https://academy.premia.blue/courses/trading-competition-initiate) (the “Trading Competition”) and use of the related Premia services (the “Services”). By entering into the Trading Competition, you agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms.

**1. CONTACT**

If you have any questions about these Terms, please get in touch with Premia by emailing [contact@premia.blue](mailto:contact@premia.blue).

**2. GENERAL ELIGIBILITY**

In order for you to participate in the Trading Competition, you represent and warrant that you satisfy the following general eligibility requirements:

• Age: You must be at least 18 years of age, or higher based on the age of majority in your jurisdiction.

• Location: You are not located in or a resident of China, Cuba, Crimea and Sevastopol, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, North Korea, or any other country in which participation in the Trading Competition may be restricted or considered unlawful, such as Thailand and Malaysia (each a “Restricted Country”).&#x20;

• Individual Person: You may only enter and participate in the Trading Competition on your own behalf as an individual, natural person. You may not enter or participate on behalf of a legal entity, or other group or organization.&#x20;

**3. GENERAL CONDITIONS**

In addition to any other conditions included in these Terms with which you must comply, please also be aware of the following:

• Compliance with Applicable Laws: You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules and not be prohibited from using the Services in any way due to applicable laws, regulations, and rules, including if you are located in a Restricted Country.

• No Use in Restricted Countries: You must not access or use, or attempt to access or use, the Services while located in a Restricted Country. For the avoidance of doubt, the Services are not offered to those in Restricted Countries, and you must not seek or attempt to circumvent the measures and procedures in place to access the Services from a Restricted Country.

• One Account Per User: You must only use one account to participate in the Trading Competition. You may not participate in the Trading Competition if your account (or an account for any other service or application of a Premia group company) has been disabled in the past.

• Prohibited Conduct: When using the Services, you will not, nor permit any person to: use the Services in any unlawful manner or for an unlawful purpose; violate or infringe the rights of Premia, Premia’s users, or other third parties, including rights in respect of privacy, intellectual property, or other proprietary rights; provide false, inaccurate or misleading information; transmit any communication, material, or other content that is illegal, obscene, defamatory, threatening, intimidating, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or which could instigate or encourage conduct that would be illegal or otherwise inappropriate, including promoting violent crimes; impersonate a person or an entity; or otherwise seek to harm Premia or any of Premia’s users or customers.

• Account Security: You are responsible for keeping your device, your cryptocurrency wallet address, your account, and any security codes/passwords safe and secure. If your account has been hacked, compromised, or breached in any way, please contact Premia immediately at contact@premia.blue.

**4. WALLET SCREENING – ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (“AML”) / COMBATING THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM (“CFT”)**

In addition to any other conditions included in these Terms, please also be aware that Premia utilizes third party software provided by Elliptic Enterprises Limited (“Elliptic”) to screen the digital wallet for each entrant to the Trading Competition as part of Premia’s AML/CFT policies. Elliptic analyzes all transactions across all major blockchains and assets and provides a holistic wallet risk score for each digital wallet, reflecting the likelihood that the wallet has been utilized in illicit or otherwise improper conduct.  Per Premia’s policies, the holder of a wallet with a risk score beyond an established threshold will be denied use of the use of the Trading Competition Services. Premia does not store wallet risk scores, nor use the wallet risk scores for any purpose beyond determining eligibility of a particular wallet holder to use the Trading Competition or other Premia Services.

In order for you to participate in the Trading Competition, you represent and warrant that Premia may facilitate the AML/CFT screening of your presented digital wallet, strictly for the purposes of developing a holistic risk score associated with your wallet. You also acknowledge that if Premia determines your wallet risk score to be beyond Premia’s acceptable threshold, you may not participate in the Trading Competition.&#x20;

If you receive a message that your wallet has been deemed too high-risk to utilize Premia’s services, and you have related questions, please email contact@premia.blue.
