# Overview

The smart contracts for Premia are a combination of The Premia Protocol, an exchange and settlement engine for crypto options on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and Premia Vaults, a set of automated return and risk-management strategies built on The Premia Protocol. The protocol was developed entirely in-house, while the vault contracts are a joint effort of in-house development and third-party additions.
