# V3 Protocol

The smart contracts for Premia combine The Premia Protocol, an exchange and settlement engine for crypto options on Arbitrum, and Premia Vaults, a set of automated return and risk-management strategies built on The Premia Protocol. The protocol was developed in-house, while the vault contracts are a joint effort of in-house development and third-party open-source additions.
