# Orderbook & Request-for-Quote (RFQ)

Market makers can provide quotes to users off-chain, either on their own platforms or through quote aggregators like the [Premia Orderbook API](../../api/orderbook-api.md). This enables makers to provide quotes to traders, without having to spend EVM gas fees updating on-chain range orders. These orders do **not** earn maker rebates, ensuring concentrated liquidity stays competitive long-term.
