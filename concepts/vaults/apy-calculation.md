# APY Calculation

APY, or Annual Percentage Yield, represents the annualized rate of return that can be anticipated from a deposit into a vault. It considers the impact of compounded profit from the vault strategy and any capital losses, resulting in a more precise estimation of earnings. Assuming no withdrawals occur, APY considers how returns contribute to the initial deposit, leading to a gradual growth in the rate of return.

**Calculated as followed**

APY = 100 \[(1 + Collateral Today/Initial Deposit)(365/Days)âˆ’1]

This is a projected APY calculation based on historical data, provided on a good faith basis, and should not be used as a basis for investment decisions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Future returns are not guaranteed, and a loss of original capital may occur.
