Market makers can provide quotes to users off-chain, either on their own platforms or through quote aggregators like the Premia Orderbook API. This enables makers to provide quotes to traders, without having to spend EVM gas fees updating on-chain range orders. These orders do **not** earn maker rebates, ensuring concentrated liquidity stays competitive long-term.
