## Premia's DEPOT Vaults

Premia's DEPOT is a specialized vault designed to cluster liquidity in battle-tested strategies. It's part of the migration from Premia V2 to Premia V3 and satisfies the ERC4626 vault standard, enabling cross-protocol compatibility. Think of it like a robo-advisor for options strategies.

**Key Features:**

1. **Tracking Option Listings**: DEPOT keeps track of its short option positions, including strike and maturity combinations.
2. **Accounting of Locked Spreads**: The quoted price includes the option's fair value, the spread charged by the vault, and the minting fee paid to the pool.
3. **Fee Collection**: Liquidity Providers (LPs) pay management and performance fees.
4. **Trade**: Users can buy call/put options from the vault, with trades passing filters based on the option's delta and the days to expiry.

## DeFi Options Vaults (DOVs)

DOVs are instruments that simplify option investment strategies by allowing participants to stake their assets in a vault while earning yield simultaneously. They automatically deploy staked assets into specific options strategies, entirely run by smart contracts.

**Key Features:**

1. **Automated Investment**: DOVs invest staked assets in options strategies for users.
2. **One-Button Investment**: Users can invest in selling or buying options through a vault and earn options premiums.
3. **Strategies**: Two main strategies are employed in DOVs: Covered Call and Cash-Secured Put. However, more advanced strategies can and should be deployed.

#### Similarities Between DEPOT and DOV

1. **Options Underwriting**: DEPOT and DOVs are involved in underwriting options, including call and put options.
2. **Automated Execution**: Both systems rely on smart contracts to automate investment.
3. **Liquidity Management**: Both DEPOT and DOVs cluster liquidity to execute options strategies.
4. **User Interaction**: In both cases, users can deposit assets, buy options, and earn premiums or spreads.

#### What are the Risks?

Premia's DEPOT and DOVs are innovative financial instruments in the DeFi space that provide automated options strategies. While DEPOT focuses on underwriting options with specific accounting and fee collection mechanisms, DOVs offer a more simplified approach to options investment. Both represent the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, leveraging blockchain technology to offer unique investment opportunities.\

All investing includes risk, and Premia's DEPOT products involve risk. Engaging in options underwriting and trading within decentralized finance, particularly with cryptocurrencies, comes with significant risks. These include but are not limited to, volatile market price fluctuations, flash crashes, potential market manipulation, and cybersecurity threats. Understand the DEPOT strategy before depositing because many strategies may have a directional bias.

Unlike traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency markets means they are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections. Premia's DEPOT's unique structure and functionality may introduce additional complexities and risks, including clustering liquidity for underwriting options.

Trading in Premia's DEPOT can lead to substantial and immediate financial losses. Participation in these products is suitable only for investors who fully understand the associated risks and can bear such potential losses. Prospective investors should consider their risk tolerance carefully and consult financial professionals before trading with Premia's DEPOT products.
