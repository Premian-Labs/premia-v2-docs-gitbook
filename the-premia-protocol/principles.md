# Principles

One of the first principles of the Premia v3 protocol is to enable permissionless use by anyone in the world. This design decision was inspired by Ethereum's core ideals and our commitment to open access as a requirement for a future in which anyone in the world can access top financial services, no matter their life circumstances.

> Permissionless design means that the protocol's services are entirely open for public use, with no ability to selectively restrict who can or cannot use them. Anyone can swap, provide liquidity, or create new markets at will. This is a departure from traditional financial services, which typically restrict access based on geography, wealth status, and age. - Uniswap.org
