# Operator & Facilitator Role

The Premian Ecosystem operated by the Premian Republic is a cooperative effort spanning many contribution groups and individuals across the globe.

The Premian Republic acts as fiduciary for the ecosystem and manages direct and coordination costs to achieve the shared vision. The Premian Republic directs its efforts to contributors focusing on building conscious, open, & contestable smart markets.

The collaborative enterprise only asks that all share a similar cultural outlook and uphold the following virtues: Equality of wealth, Equity of opportunity, and Economic justice. If these hold true to you and you would like to join our contribution network, please don't hesitate to reach out.

As we hold transparency as a core tenet, economic costs associated with fulfilling this doctrine are summarized [here](broken-reference).
