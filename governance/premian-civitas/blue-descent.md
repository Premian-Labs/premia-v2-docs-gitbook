# Blue Descent

Blue Descent is the proposed name for the Premia Community Decentralized Organization as a first step on the formalized path to decentralized governance.  It embodies the two-fold notion of our descendent line from Premia's Origins (Blue Aesthetic), but also symbolizes our community exploration of the deep blue undiscovered space that is DeFi.

The "DAO" acronym or [neologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism), is a reference that many easily understood to reflect the idea of a decentralized group of individuals, however it may be time to revisit this terminology as web3 is maturing.  We believe a new [protologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protologism) is needed to properly reflect the current state of affairs of growing crypto native organizations, and thus "DeSCEnt" was born.  A decentralized social collective enterprise.  Similarly parallel in principal to a [dORG(BBLLC)](https://github.com/dOrgTech/LL-DAO), [DisCO](https://disco.coop/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DisCO\_Manifesto-v.1.pdf), or [DO](https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/112/Amend/HA0748.pdf); although not quite exactly the same in terms of future vision for what the Premia Ecosystem hopes to evolve into.

The path to governance will be a \~18mo process where additional protections and controls are folded into the structure as the community helps build out and ratify new constructs. &#x20;

The Community Forum and Proposal Process is currently in development with end of year 2022 as the targeted timeline.  However a brief outline of the proposed iterative approach is below.&#x20;

It will consist of 4 Eras:

1. Pre-Foundation (Q4-2022)
   1. Code of Conduct & Principles, Community Legal Liability Protections
2. Foundation (Q1-Q2 2023)
   1. Onboard Tools and Proposal Applications (Commonwealth, etc), Elect 10 Community Members for first Ratification Council, Alpha Test Social Reputation, First Small Grant Fellowship, Governing Documents
3. Republic (Q3-Q4 2023)
   1. First Elected Magistrate Class, Open Organization Creations, On-Chain Alpha Voting, Scale up Grant Fellowship
4. Empire (Q1-Q2 2024)
   1. On-Chain Beta Voting, Elect Second Magistrate Class, Social Reputation Matures
