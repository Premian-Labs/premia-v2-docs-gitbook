# Overview

Any holder of the PREMIA or vxPREMIA tokens can participate in Premia Governance to conduct and oversee the improvement of Premia as a whole. Users can most actively participate in Premia Governance by staking (depositing & locking) their PREMIA tokens for non-transferrable vxPREMIA tokens, enabling them to share in fees generated by the protocol and participate in voting to distribute liquidity mining rewards to token pairs on the Premia Protocol.

In addition to voting directly on-chain for realtime updates such as liquidity mining emissions, users with vxPREMIA can vote in off-chain Snapshot votes (guaranteeing users hold the tokens at a specified snapshot before the vote starts), to supervise the direction of updates and improves to Premia.
