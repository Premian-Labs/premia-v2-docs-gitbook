Users can participate in Premia Governance by staking (depositing & locking) their PREMIA tokens. In return, users will receive non-transferrable vePREMIA tokens, enabling them to share in fees generated by the protocol and participate in voting to distribute liquidity mining rewards to token pairs on the protocol.
