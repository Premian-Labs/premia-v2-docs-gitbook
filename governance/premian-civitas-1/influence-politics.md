# "Influence" Politics

_**Influence**_ is the unit of account for voting in the Premia Meta-Economy

It is calculated by vxPREMIA holdings \* Boost and the purpose is to align long term vision with economics.  Instead of separating the multi-stakeholders of the platform, the Influence mechanism converges the interests of citizens, contributors, and participants (LPs & Traders) into one cohesive standard measure.

Today Influence can be allocated in Governance via Snapshot vote, or used to control valve gauge weights via the Rewards Manifold control.

As Premia's decentralized governance grows via the [Blue Descent](blue-descent.md), Influence will be a critical component to policy, parameter control, representatives, funding, organizations, and the overall Republic.
